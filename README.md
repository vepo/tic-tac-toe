## Tic Tac Toe with Scala 3

### Environment

Developed and tested with:
* Java 19 (Check Scala requirement)
* Scala >= 3.2.0
* sbt   >= 1.7.2

Use [SDKMan!](https://sdkman.io/) for easy environment setup!

### Usage

This is a normal sbt project. You can compile code with `sbt compile`, run it with `sbt run`, and `sbt console` will start a Scala 3 REPL.
